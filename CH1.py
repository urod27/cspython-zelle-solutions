# Review questions

# 1. Computer science is not the study of computers. Computers are simply a tool to design, analyze, and experiment with
#       information.
#
# 2. The Central Processing Unit is the brain of the computer. The CPU accesses information that is stored in main
#       memory (this main memory is called Random Access Memory). Input devices such as a keyboard or monitor is
#       processed also by the CPU. The CPU follows a "fetch-execute cycle" for processing: fetch -> decode -> execute.
#
# 3. Secondary memory on a personal computer is usually either an internal hard disk drive (HDD) or
#       solid disk drive (SSD). HHD uses magnetic patterns on a spinning disk and SSD uses flash memory.
#
# 4. When a program is started the following happens in order:
#       1) A copy from secondary memory is made to the main memory (RAM)
#       2) CPU executes the program once it is loaded
#
# 5. SEMANTICS refers to "precise meaning". SYNTAX refers to "precise form" or structure. Semantics comes after syntax.
#       As an example using modern English: "Bill is jumping while sitting by the fire place.", is syntactically
#       correct, but not semantically (no meaning).
#
# 6. A function executes a specific task. It takes data in and returns a result after processing.
#
# 7. A programming environment refers to an IDE. The one I like to use is PyCharm.
#
# 8. A variable in Python works like in a math class. Variables are ASSIGNED to data (assignment). The best way to
#       think of it in Python is as a "sticky-note". For example, a variable named "coolio" acts like a sticky note for
#       some data that I want to assign such that
#       coolio = 1 * 4
#
# 9. A loop is for repeating or iterating an operation. Best way to think of it is in terms of graph theory, where an
#       edge is connected to a vertex to itself.
#
# 10. Chaos theory as it relates to computer science: some dynamic systems are irregular, unpredictable, and very very
#       sensitive to initial values, and computers cannot predict precise enough measurements for some models and
#       predictions. Ultimately, even correct programs can yield incorrect results if the initial inputs/values are not
#       precise enough. A math model is considered chaotic if very small changes to input lead to changes large enough
#       to be considered random, this limits the power of computing.
#
# Multiple Choice questions
#
# 1. CS is a tool the science of information and its manipulation to solve problems, B.
#
# 2. Algorithms are like recipes, a set of instructions, D.
#
# 3. Intractable problems are problems that require too much time or memory (computing power), D.
#
# 4. RAM is main memory, A.
#
# 5. Humans need low-level machine language translated into high-level language, B.
#
# 6. A statement is a complete command, B.
#
# 7. High-level language can be either 1) compiled or 2) interpreted. A compiler takes source code and compiles
#       high-level source code to machine code BEFORE the program is executed. Once this is performed, the program/code
#       does not need to be compiled again (translation happens once). An interpreter has to translate as the program
#       runs, but it is more flexible across platforms since it is not dependent on the CPU. The interpreter simulates
#       the computer "understanding" high-level source code, C.
#
# 8. A sequence of commands are statements for the Python interpreter to execute. Statements of a program are often
#       placed in a function main, B.
#
# 9. The answer is A, self explanatory.
#
# 10. Parameters are synonymous with arguments in reference to a function, D.
#
#
# 1. Compare and contrast the following pairs of concepts from the chapter:
# a) Hardware vs. Software
#   Software (programs) rules the hardware (physical machine). Software determines what the computer can do.
# b) Algorithm vs. Program
#   A computer program is a detailed, step by step of instructions telling the computer what to do. An algorithm is a
#   step by step process for achieving a desired result. An algorithm performs a very specific task and there could be
#   multiple algorithms in one computer program. An analogy for this: follow an algorithm for making tomato sauce,
#   and you'll have one of the recipes completed for a pizza. The program in this analogy is the pizza. Also, there does
#   have to be an algorithm in a computer program.
# c) Programming Language vs. Natural Language
#   A high-level programming language is closer to resembling natural language than low-level languages. Semantics and
#   syntax play an important role for programming languages and natural language.
# d) High-Level Language vs. Machine Language
#   Machine language is binary, high-level resembles more closely with natural English language. Refer to #7 above.
# e) Interpreter vs. Compiler
#   #7 above.
# f) Syntax vs. Semantics
#   Refer to #7 in section above.

# 2. List and explain in your own words the role of each of the five basic functional units of a computer depicted
# in Figure 1.1.
#   Input devices: keyboards, mouse, etc. Provides data and control signals to computer.
#   CPU: "brain of the computer"
#   Main memory: RAM; fast, volatile; the CPU can only access information from main memory; fast, expensive, small
#   capacity.
#   Secondary memory: A location where programs and data are kept in long term storage; slow, cheap, large capacity,
#   not directly tied to CPU.
#   Output devices: printers, displays, etc. Sends data and control signals to device.
#
# 3. Write a detailed algorithm for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
#   Intentionally skipping this question in the book.
