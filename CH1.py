# Review questions

# 1. Computer science is not the study of computers. Computers are simply a tool to design, analyze, and experiment with
#       information.
#
# 2. The Central Processing Unit is the brain of the computer. The CPU accesses information that is stored in the main
#       memory (this main memory is called Random Access Memory). Input devices such as a keyboard or monitor is
#       processed also by the CPU. The CPU follows a "fetch-execute cycle" for processing: fetch -> decode -> execute.
#
# 3. Secondary memory on a personal computer is usually either an internal hard disk drive (HDD) or
#       solid disk drive (SSD). HHD uses magnetic patterns on a spinning disk and SSD uses flash memory.
#
# 4. When a program is started the following happens in order:
#       1) A copy from secondary memory is made to the main memory (RAM)
#       2) CPU executes the program once it is loaded
#
# 5. SEMANTICS refers to "precise meaning". SYNTAX refers to "precise form" or structure. Semantics comes after syntax.
#       As an example using modern English: "Bill is jumping while sitting by the fire place.", is syntactically
#       correct, but not semantically (no meaning).
#
# 6. A function executes a specific task. It takes data in and returns a result after processing.
#
# 7. A programming environment refers to an IDE. The one I like to use is PyCharm.
#
# 8. A variable in Python works like in a math class. Variables are ASSIGNED to data (assignment). The best way to
#       think of it in Python is as a "sticky-note". For example, a variable named "coolio" acts like a sticky note for
#       some data that I want to assign such that
#       coolio = 1 * 4
#
# 9. A loop is for repeating or iterating an operation. Best way to think of it is in terms of graph theory, where an
#       edge is connected to a vertex to itself.
#
# 10. Chaos theory as it relates to computer science: some dynamic systems are irregular, unpredictable, and very very
#       sensitive to initial values, and computers cannot predict precise enough measurements for some models and
#       predictions. Ultimately, even correct programs can yield incorrect results if the initial inputs/values are not
#       precise enough. A math model is considered chaotic if very small changes to input lead to changes large enough
#       to be considered random, this limits the power of computing.
#
# Multiple Choice questions
#
# 1. CS is a tool the science of information and its manipulation to solve problems, B.
#
# 2. Algorithms are like recipes, a set of instructions, D.
#
# 3. Intractable problems are problems that require too much time or memory (computing power), D.
#
# 4. RAM is main memory, A.
#
# 5. Humans need low-level machine language translated into high-level language, B.
#
# 6. A statement is complete command, B.
#
# 7. High-level language can be either 1) compiled or 2) interpreted. A compiler takes source code and compiles
#       high-level source code to machine code BEFORE the program is executed. Once this is performed, the program/code
#       does not need to be compiled again (translation happens once). An interpreter has to translate as the program
#       runs, but it is more flexible across platforms since it is not dependent on the CPU. The interpreter simulates
#       the computer "understanding" high-level source code, C.
#
# 8. A sequence of commands are statements for the Python interpreter to execute. Statements of a program are often
#       placed in a function main, B.
#
# 9. The answer is A, self explanatory.
#
# 10. Parameters are synonymous with arguments in reference to a function, D.
#
#
#Compare and contrast the following pairs of concepts from the chapter:
a) Hardware vs. Software
b) Algorithm vs. Program
c) Programming Language vs. Natural Language
d) High-Level Language vs. Machine Language
e) Interpreter vs. Compiler
f ) Syntax vs. Semantics
2. List and explain in your own words the role of each of the five basic functional
units of a computer depicted in Figure 1.1.
3. Write a detailed algorithm for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
(or some other everyday activity). You should assume that you are talking
to someone who is conceptually able to do the task, but has never actually
done it before. For example, you might be telling a young child.
