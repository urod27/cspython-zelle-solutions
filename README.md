My own solutions to textbook practice questions to John Zelle's Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, 3rd Edition

Feel free to offer any input on how to improve or clean any code.

The purpose of this project is to solidify fundamentals I learned in my introduction to computer science course where we used an entirely different textbook and problems. Practice makes perfect, and I believe this is a productive segue into the the next CS course, which has more complex programs and dives deeper into OOP topics.

The style of the way I wrote the answers will be in the format of me sort of teaching a classroom rather than answering a question. The thought process for this is for this to be a resource for anyone that wants to use it.
